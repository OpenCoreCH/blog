With ctypes, this can be implemented quite easily. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a shared library libcpp.so where a function get_shared_memory returns the pointer to an array of doubles that is stored on the heap:
cpp double* get_shared_memory(std::size_t num) { auto p = new double[num]; .</description></item><item><title>How to perform zero-copy S3 uploads with the AWS C++ SDK</title><link>https://blog.opencore.ch/posts/aws-cpp-sdk-zero-copy-upload/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.opencore.ch/posts/aws-cpp-sdk-zero-copy-upload/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re ever using the AWS C++ SDK in some constrained environment (such as Lambda functions with limited memory) or care about memory copies, you probably run into the issue of how to upload an existing buffer without copying it (as other developers did). You can write your own streambuf wrapper to do so, but if you&amp;rsquo;re already using boost in your project, boost::interprocess::bufferstream is a very straightforward way to do it:</description></item></channel></rss>
