To add it, simply run the following command on the SavaPage server:
lpadmin -p uniflow_queue -v smb://serviceaccount:servicepassword@domain/uniflow_server/uniflow_queue -P path/to/driver.ppd While this works, all print jobs will arrive at the uniFLOW server with the used serviceaccount. SavaPage sends the username of the user that submitted the job in the For attribute of the transmitted PostScript file.</description></item><item><title>Unicode Normalization Forms: When รถ != รถ</title><link>https://blog.opencore.ch/posts/unicode-normalization-forms/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.opencore.ch/posts/unicode-normalization-forms/</guid><description>Some time ago, a very weird issue was reported to me about a Nextcloud system. The user uploaded a file with an &amp;ldquo;รถ&amp;rdquo; on a SMB share that was configured as an external storage in the Nextcloud server. But when accessing the folder containing the file over WebDAV, it did not appear (no matter which WebDAV client was used). After ruling out the usual causes (wrong permissions, etc&amp;hellip;), I analyzed the network traffic between the WebDAV client and the server and saw that the file name is indeed not returned after issuing a PROPFIND.</description></item></channel></rss>
